Database Design and Implementation: (School Course Schedule)
I have designed and Implemented a School Course Schedule Database as my Database Systems Course Project.

In this project i have implemented Stored Procedures, Triggers, views and indexes.

All the Data base design rules are followed and all the tables are normalized to 4th normal form ,
 as normalizing the data to more levels decreases the performance of Database, 
 i have stopped the Normalization at 4NF.

I have also created Indexes to improve the performance of Database.
created almost 20+ procedures to serve various utilities

Created 20+ triggers to 

As this project is for Database Systems Course i have concentrated only on designing the database by following all the design principles.
