HELTHCARE SYSTEM
The primary objective of the project is to create a database with required data validations as mentioned. The database is in turn used for generating welcome letters in xml format for each subscriber.
 
The following are the modules in this proposed system
a) Group
b) Sub Group
c) Subscribe

Scope of the system
The scope of the system is explained through its modules as follows
· Group – This module is to analyze the Group information provided and load them into the database in the corresponding Group table.
· Sub Group – This module is to analyze the Sub Group information provided and load them into the database in the corresponding Sub Group table with only the matching groups in the Group table that is previously loaded.
· Subscriber – This module is to analyze the Subscriber information provided and load them into the database in the corresponding Subscriber table with only the matching groups in the Group table and sub groups in the subgroup table that were previously loaded

Functional Requirements
1.3.1 Group

Functional Requirements
1. Rename the input file as Group_Fixed_<Associate_Id>.txt and Group_Comma_<Associate_Id>.csv. 
2. Create a table in sql plus by name Group_<Associate_Id>.
 3. Validate the data from the input file and load only valid records into the target table according to the constraints mentioned in the target table.
 4. Load only the members who are currently effective. (i.e) SYSDATE BETWEEN EFFT_DT AND TERM_DT.
5. Populate leading zeroes in GROUP_ID field while populating into the target table.
6. GRP_SK is the surrogate key.
