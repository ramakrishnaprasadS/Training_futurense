map reduce
 -distributed processing
 -processing happens where data resides
 -executes tasks in parallel

map task happens on each input split

input--> logical split --> map --> shuffle -->reduce -->split

splitting --> key,value 
mapping -->maps the list of values for keys for each record
shuffle -->


Map Reduce Advanced concepts

    -Combiners  ----> will run on mapper level
        -local-Reducers : 


    -partitioner --> will run on reducer level

    -Map side join-->perform join before data reaches map functions,used when one of dataset is small
    -reduce side join --> used when both the datasets are large
    -Distributed cache ---> very small(less than 150mb) reference data can be joined using this. can be done at mapper or reducer level

    -Counters: can track the completion of map or reduce tasks....records bytes of data read,processed,number of types of records processed etc...

    Hadoop input format
        -input split
        -record reader (logic to read records)
        -mapper
    
    hadoop output format
        - Reducer
        - Record Writer
        - Output File 

    Resource Manager
        -application masters
        -scheduler
            -fair scheduler
            -capacity scheduler
