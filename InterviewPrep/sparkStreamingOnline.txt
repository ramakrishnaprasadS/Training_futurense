streaming Vs batch

streaming: continuous data arrival or continous flow of events

    ex: continous flow of tweets is stream of tweets
    ex: uber wants to collect the gps of all taxis at location, and gps location of taxis is obtained as stream 
    ex: Stream of log messages


usecases:

    1.Amazon detecting if order placed is Fraud.
        order stream ------> Order Fraud Detection ------> Order Accepted or Cancelled
        we will get stream of orders ....we will place them in a system to process orders....and will decide whtether it is fraud or not

    2.Log Processing Platform
        Web Log Stream ---->Log Processing System ---->Alert Raised Or Not
        if there is eeror message in in coming log streams......we need send the alert...

    3.Taxi sharing Platform
        Customer Taxi Request ----> Customer and Driver Matcing----Taxi Allotment
        should collect the stream of incoming requests.....and process them ....to get taxi allocated

Basics of Spark Streaming:

    Dstream -->sequence of rdds over time

    Dstream ---> rdd1 rdd2 rdd3   .....

    batch interval: the time interval for which we want to batch the events
                    ex; for every 10sec we will process the batch

    Spark streaming context:
        -Entry Point for streaming Application
        -Manages your streaming application
        -ineracts with spark context and makes the job done
